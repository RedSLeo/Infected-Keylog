# Infected-Keylog (Work in progress)
This was a project that I decided to work on for a computing class, if you are planning to tinker around with it please use it with the right intentions and use a virtual machine if you plan on testing it. 
# What does it do (so far)
The Keylogger is software that records or monitors the keystrokes made on a computer, capturing every keystroke such as letters, numbers, symbols and function keys like Enter or Backspace and logs them on a local file or it can send to a personal email of your choice.

# Future Capability, etc
This is still a work in progress so I plan to include the capabilities of making it autorun when injected into another computer through a flashdrive. I may also expand it's functions as much as possible for the sake of my own education such as implementing stealth, screen logging, and remote access
